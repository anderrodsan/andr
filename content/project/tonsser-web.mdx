### TUF4: The First Tournament Website

The **Tonsser United Final Four (TUF4)** tournament was happening, and I was assigned to create the website to **attract scouts and clubs** to attend. The goal was to **increase the competition’s prestige** and strengthen the **Tonsser brand**.

Working closely with **co-founder Simon Hjærre**, I translated his initial slide-based designs into a fully functional website. Since Tonsser used **Webflow**, I built it there, despite it being my **first time using the tool**. With a **tight deadline**, I designed the site in **Figma** and launched the **first version in under a week**.

### Iterating with Stakeholders

I collaborated with multiple stakeholders, including **sales, product, and CEO Peter Holm**, refining the page structure, content, and storytelling. It was crucial to ensure the **right narrative flow**, emphasizing key messages for visitors.

The success of this project led to **redesigning the landing page and Tonsser United pages**.

### Improving the Landing Page & Tonsser United

The previous landing page had a **confusing structure** and lacked a clear message. We reworked it by:

1. **Identifying key content** to highlight.
2. **Defining a page skeleton** for structure and flow.
3. **Designing & building modular sections in Webflow**.
4. **Iterating and refining** based on internal feedback.

The **same approach** was used to improve the **Tonsser United** page and **Player Stories**, ensuring a **cohesive and engaging experience** across the site.

## Challenges

- **Tight deadlines** – I had to design and launch quickly.
- **New to Webflow** – Learned and built a full website in a week.
- **New to Tonsser** – Had to quickly understand the brand, app, and goals to execute a strong design.

## Key Learnings
