<h2>Problem</h2>
Having lived in a dorm for 2 years and served on the resident council, I observed
that most dorm issues stem from communication problems.{" "}

<h4>Current services</h4>
In Denmark, dorms typically make use of multiple platforms:

- **Websites:** For public communication, news, events, etc., usually maintained by third-party companies.
- **Facebook:** For public communication relating to news, events, etc.
- **Email:** For private messages such as issue requests, etc.

<h4>Issues with current services</h4>
However, the usage of those platforms usually comes with the following issues:

- **Scattered Communication Platforms:** Tenants often feel lost with the variety of services, especially when moving in, and there is no existing dorm-tailored platform yet.
- **Facebook:** Overloaded with features and distractions.
- **Emails:** Important messages can easily get lost or buried.
- **Websites:** Require maintenance by third-party companies.

<h2>Solution</h2>

To address these issues, I developed DormHive. This app consolidates all dorm-related communication into one easy-to-use platform, combining the best features of existing services while eliminating their drawbacks.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

- **Feed:** Everything in one place. Shortcuts, upcoming. events, news...
- **Alerts and News:** Get relevant alerts and news from the administration.
- **Chat Groups:** Custom groups for each tenants based on their room.
- **Events:** Create and view events happening in the dorm.
- **Marketplace:** Sell and trade products with other tenants.
- **Report Issues:** Easily report issues to the admin and keep track of their state.
- **Book Facilities:** Offer tenants a way to reserve facilities or equipment.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

These are the frameworks and languages I used to develop the app.

- **Expo**
- **React Native**
- **Tailwind CSS (Nativewind)**
- **Typescript**
- **Supabase**
