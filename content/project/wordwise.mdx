<h2>Problem</h2>
I've been on a Danish-learning journey for over a year now. My approach? It's a mix
of reading, consuming content, conversing with natives, and associating new words
with those activities. But here's the issue: whenever I encounter a new word, I resort
to Google Translate, but then those words get lost in the air. And as a passionate
data enthusiast, that just didn't sit well with me.

<h2>Solution</h2>
That's when inspiration struck: why not create an app to ease the process? I can
input any word, tag it, and get an instant translation. The app then automatically
saves these words with their translations, dates, and categories. Plus, I've thrown
in a useful flashcard feature to level up my vocabulary game.
