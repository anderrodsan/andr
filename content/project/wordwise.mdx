## Overview

**WordWise** is a language-learning app designed to help users translate and save new vocabulary, practice them with flashcards, and keep everything organized by tags and languages — all while working 100% offline.

With a clean UI, fast performance, and playful features like emojis, the app makes vocabulary building more engaging and efficient.

## Problem

While learning Danish, I’d often come across new words through books, videos, or conversations. I used Google Translate, but the words I looked up would just vanish into thin air. I needed a way to **capture and practice** these new words, track my learning, and build a personalized dictionary over time.

## Solution

WordWise allows users to:

- Translate words instantly using **Google MLKit**
- Save them locally with tags, emojis, and language-specific dictionaries
- Practice words using a smart **flashcard system**
- Organize their vocabulary and track learning over time

Everything works offline, making it perfect for travelers or language learners on the go.

## Key Features

- **Instant translations**: Supports 50+ languages (offline)
- **Customize words**: Add emojis, tags, personal notes and group words however you like
- **Organized word list**: Easily view, filter, and sort your saved words
- **Flashcard practice**: Strengthen memory with an effective review system
- **Progress tracking**: See how many words you’ve learned over time and other relevant statistics

## Tech Stack

- **Expo (React Native)**
- **Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind)**
- **TypeScript**
- **SQLite**
- **Drizzle ORM**
- **Zustand (state management)**
- **Google MLKit (offline translation)**
- **Shopify FlashList (for large lists)**

## Behind the Build

### From API to Offline Translation

The first version used the **Google Translate API**, but I wanted the app to be **free and local-first**. I discovered **Google MLKit**, which supports offline translation for 50+ languages — perfect for both sustainability and performance.

### From JSON to SQLite

Initially, I stored word lists in a JSON file. While simple, it wasn’t scalable. As the app grew, I moved to **SQLite** for structured local storage — improving speed, enabling table-based organization, and making future features easier to add.

### Enter Drizzle ORM

Maintaining the database manually and syncing state was painful. **Drizzle ORM** came to the rescue with:

- Type-safe queries
- Easy migrations
- **Live queries** to auto-refresh the UI when data changes
- Huge performance boost — word list render time dropped from 10s to instantly

### FlashList to the Rescue

React Native’s FlatList struggled with performance when scrolling through long word lists. I swapped it with **Shopify’s FlashList** — and now it scrolls smoothly even with hundreds of items.

## Design Iteration

### UX Evolution

The home screen went through several iterations to improve the user experience:

- Easier tag creation
- Smoother translation flow
- Clear save feedback and UI interactions

### UI Makeover

The original app looked very plain — minimal colors, basic typography. To improve engagement, I:

- Introduced **vibrant color palettes** and gradients
- Added **3D-style buttons**
- Switched to the **Poppins** font for a modern look
- Integrated **emojis** with every word

Emojis weren’t just fun — they help users **visually associate** meaning.

## Current Status

I’m currently doing a **closed test** with ~20 users. The plan is to:

- Gather feedback
- Fix bugs and polish
- Launch publicly on **May 1st, 2025**

## What’s Next

### Free Forever

The core features will always be free. To support the app long term:

- I’ll introduce **ads** for non-premium users
- Offer a **Pro plan** with extra features

### Cloud Sync

Planned for future versions:

- Cloud database
- User authentication and profiles
- Auto backup and sync across devices
