summary: "Redesigned and developed Tonsser’s public player profiles website, improving UI, navigation, and shareability while enhancing player exposure."

## Description

I redesigned and developed Tonsser’s **public player profiles website**, transforming it from a **flat, unscannable UI** into an engaging, **visually rich** platform. The goal was to give players a **LinkedIn-style profile**, making it easier to **showcase their careers, share stats, and connect with others**.

I improved **UI hierarchy**, added **better navigation**, and integrated player videos for greater exposure. Working with **Ruby on Rails**, I rebuilt the website with **Tailwind CSS and ERB templates**, improving maintainability and usability.

This project expanded Tonsser’s reach, giving players a **shareable online presence** while improving **engagement and visibility**.

## Background

Until now, the only way for users to see player profiles was through the Tonsser app, which **limited the exposure of players**. To solve this, the team decided to create a **brand-new public player profiles website** where anyone could access and share profiles.

### Why was this important?

- **Increased Exposure:** Players could have a **public profile**, similar to LinkedIn, showcasing their career.
- **More Engagement:** This encouraged players to use the app more actively and refine their stats.
- **Easier Sharing:** Users could share their profiles on social media, reaching audiences beyond Tonsser users.

Additionally, the website needed to support **player-uploaded videos**, allowing users to showcase their performance through media that could be shared publicly.

## My Role

I was responsible for **redesigning and developing** these two websites. The existing versions had several issues:

## Problems with the Existing Design

### 1. Flat and Unscannable UI

- Data was displayed in **tables** with **labels** highlighted instead of values.
- This made it **difficult to scan** and visually unappealing.
- Videos were displayed with a **standard player UI**, lacking context or player information.

### 2. Poor Linkability

- The **player profiles and media pages were disconnected**—users couldn’t navigate between them.
- Once inside a profile or video page, users were **stuck** without an intuitive way to explore related content.

---

## Solutions & Redesign Approach

### 1. **Improved UI & Visual Hierarchy**

- **Divided data into sections** instead of plain tables, following a **bento grid** layout.
- **Highlighted values instead of labels** to improve readability.
- Added **flags, icons, images, gradients, and rounded corners** for a more engaging experience.

### 2. **Enhanced Navigation & Linkability**

- Connected **player profiles and media pages**, allowing users to **seamlessly switch between them**.
- Introduced **clear CTAs** for sharing profiles and videos externally.

## Design Process

I was given **full creative freedom** with the only instruction: **"Improve the website."**

### 1. **Research & Inspiration**

I analyzed existing football apps like **FotMob, Sofascore, and Transfermarkt**, which use a **bento grid** layout for player stats.

### 2. **Consistency with Tonsser's App**

To maintain brand consistency, I:

- Extracted **theme colors, typography, and components** from the Tonsser app.
- Ensured the website followed the app’s design language but **with improvements**.

### 3. **Rapid Prototyping in Figma**

- Created multiple designs and experimented with different layouts.
- Shared prototypes with the **product and development teams** for feedback.
- Made **minor adjustments** based on input, finalizing the design **quickly**.

## Development

### **Tech Stack & Setup**

- The website was already built with **Ruby on Rails** using **HAML and CSS files**.
- I proposed using **Tailwind CSS** and **ERB templates** for better maintainability.
- Set up a **DevContainer** to streamline the development process.

### **Building the New Website**

- Created **new layouts** and **restructured controllers** to fetch the right data.
- Developed **reusable components** for efficiency.
- Completed the project in **2-3 weeks**.
- Wrote **tests** to ensure functionality before deploying live.

## Challenges

1. **Learning Ruby on Rails Quickly**: This was my first time working with **Ruby on Rails**, and the setup was difficult on my Windows laptop.

   - Solved it by setting up a **DevContainer** for a smoother workflow.

2. **Adjusting to Rails' Data Handling**: Coming from **React/Next.js**, understanding **Rails controllers** took time but became easier with practice.

3. **Testing**: Writing tests for Rails was challenging initially, but I quickly adapted.

## What I Learned

✅ **Fast Adaptation to New Tech Stacks**: Learned **Ruby on Rails** and built a production-ready website in **less than a month**.

✅ **Proactive Problem-Solving**: Designed the website **while waiting on other tasks**, working independently with full ownership.

✅ **Improved UX & Visual Design Skills**: Enhanced my **UI/UX thinking** by applying best practices from leading sports platforms.

✅ **Effective Collaboration**: Worked closely with **stakeholders, product teams, and developers** to align on the best solutions.

## Final Thoughts

This project was an exciting challenge where I combined **UI/UX improvements, frontend development, and backend integration** to build a **public-facing platform** that expanded Tonsser’s reach. The final result provided **players with better exposure, improved usability, and seamless sharing options**—all while maintaining a strong visual identity aligned with the Tonsser brand.
