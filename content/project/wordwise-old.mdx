<h2>Problem</h2>
I've been on a Danish-learning journey for over a year now. My approach? It's a
mix of reading, consuming content, conversing with natives, and associating new
words with those activities. But here's the issue: whenever I encounter a new
word, I resort to Google Translate, but then those words get lost in the air.
And as a passionate data enthusiast, that just didn't sit well with me.

<h2>Solution</h2>
That's when inspiration struck: why not create an app to ease the process? I can
input any word, tag it, and get an instant translation. The app then
automatically saves these words with their translations, dates, and categories.
Plus, I've thrown in a useful flashcard feature to level up my vocabulary game.
