Welcome to my newest web portfolio, crafted using technologies and frameworks including NextJS, MDX, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This blog will focus on explaining why and how I created it on my own.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Firstly, I want to introduce you to my prior portfolios that enabled me to achieve
this result.

<h4>First Portfolio</h4>I built my first web portfolio back in 2022 when I
learned the basics of coding with React. I wanted to experiment with the
framework and present myself to the world in a creative way. With almost no
prior coding experience, I managed to code the one-page portfolio in less than
two weeks. As it was a personal project with no commercial purpose, I chose
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website. You can still
find it at [My First Portfolio 2022](https://anderrodsan.github.io/portfolio/).

<h4>Second Portfolio</h4>
Last year (2023), I was introduced to the NextJS + TailwindCSS + Radix UI tech stack.
I immediately appreciated how easy the setup and app router system was, along with
the styling libraries that allowed me to enhance my websites with just a few lines
of code. After developing projects like [DormHive](https://www.dormhive.com/) and
gaining more experience, I realized I needed to rebuild my portfolio to apply everything
I had learned. I wanted to maintain simplicity, so I kept it as a single-page site.
I used UI component libraries like [Acceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) and
[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to give it an extra polished look.

This time, I selected [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as the hosting platform for its ease and speed of deployment. The portfolio can still be found at [My Second Portfolio](https://andr-portfolio.vercel.app/).

<h4>Current Portfolio</h4>
Upon visiting my previous website, one might think there was no need to create a
new one. While that may be true, I had a compelling reason to do so. As my projects
grew, I wanted to start generating documentation and information about them, which
was not possible with my previous setup. This led me to create the current website,
which combines NextJS and MDX, making it ideal for blogs and improving its' SEO.
I also decided to divide the website into multiple pages such as About, Projects,
and Blog to provide more detailed information on each.
